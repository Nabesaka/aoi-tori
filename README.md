# Aoi Tori - A Twitter Plugin for WordPress

Aoi Tori is a Twitter Plugin for WordPress. You can install it directly via your WordPress dashboard by going to your plugins area and searching for Aoi Tori. It is hosted here for proper version control and pushed to SVN so it can appear on the WordPress plugin directory.

For more information on please check out [Aoi Tori's documentation](https://nabesaka.github.io/aoi-tori).

**Note:** Keen eyes may have spotted the `vendor` folder has been uploaded. This was done purposefully. Since this Github repo will be a direct mirror for the SVN repo it must contain all of the files required for it to work for the general end-user. Since running `composer install` would be awkward for most and impossible on some shared hosting, it is included so that isn't required.
